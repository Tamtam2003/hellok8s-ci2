# hellok8s-ci2  
Full CI/CD pipeline deploying a Flask application to a Kubernetes (Minikube) cluster using Jenkins, Docker, Terraform (infra), and Ansible.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a complete DevOps workflow for deploying a containerized Flask microservice to Kubernetes through an automated CI/CD pipeline.

The pipeline:
1. Builds a Docker image for the Flask app  
2. Pushes it to DockerHub (`tamarmey`)  
3. Triggers an Ansible deployment to Minikube  
4. Applies updated Kubernetes manifests  
5. Performs a clean rollout of the application  

This is a practical, end-to-end example of modern DevOps deployment automation.
